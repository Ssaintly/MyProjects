    <p>Time Travel: or Apocalyptic: Science Fiction We have discussed, over the semester, several different common themes of science fiction.</p>

<header><h2>Space related</h2></header>
<p>In many countries, a big proportion of expenditure is being spent on exploring the space. It is argued that this <code>expenditure should be spent on other important things rather than on space exploration</code>.</p>
<p>However, in my opinion, keep other significant things in mind, space program is very crucial and important for the whole world and should be funded due to the fact that it will help to improve the communication between countries in the world and also helping to search a new alternate to live.</p>

<p><code>Geography as a university discipline</code> got recognition in the early decades of the 19th century in the German universities and subsequently in the French and British universities.</p>
<p>During the period of evolution, geography, like all other sister social science disciplines, faced many philosophical and methodological problems. Geography did not develop as a well-regulated activity.</p>
